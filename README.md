# Quick Start

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

## Initial Setup

**Clone Repository**:

```
git clone https://github.com/tecnics-python/dsp-boilerplate
```

**Install Dependencies**:

```
yarn install
```

## Setup Application
   To setup the application, follow these steps:

```
yarn setup
```

If you run the command `yarn setup` in your project with the provided scripts, the following sequence of commands will be executed, each performing a specific task related to OpenAPI schema generation and database setup.

#### Steps

1. **Generate OpenAPI schemas**:
   - **Command**: `yarn generate-openapi-schemas`
   - This command uses `typeconv` to convert TypeScript types into OpenAPI schemas. The output is saved to the `src/swagger/schemas` directory.

2. **Generate OpenAPI spec**:
   - **Command**: `yarn generate-openapi-spec`
   - This runs a TypeScript script (`openapi-spec-generator.ts`) that generates the OpenAPI specification document based on the schemas from the previous step.

3. **Generate DB URL**:
   - **Command**: `yarn generate-db-url`
   - This runs a TypeScript script (`generateDbUrl.ts`) that generates or modifies the database connection URL based on environment variables or some other logic specific to your project.

4. **Migrate the database**:
   - **Command**: `yarn migrate-db`
   - This command applies any pending Prisma migrations to your database, using the schema defined in `src/prisma/schema.prisma`. After migration, the Prisma client is generated.

5. **Load seed data**:
   - **Command**: `yarn load-seed-data`
   - This script runs a TypeScript file (`seed.ts`) that populates the database with seed data, typically used for initial testing or development.

6. **Initialize the database**:
   - **Command**: `yarn init-db`
   - This combines the previous steps of generating the database URL, migrating the database, and loading the seed data, effectively setting up the database from scratch.

7. **Final setup**:
   - The `yarn setup` command runs all the above commands in sequence, ensuring that both the OpenAPI specifications and the database are properly configured and initialized.

## Application Queue Processing

This application provides flexible queue processing through two methods: **AWS SQS** and **BullMQ**. The method used is determined by a configuration parameter `queueProcessingMethod`, and the system initializes the respective queue handler based on that value.

### Overview

The application supports the following key functionalities:
- Queue processing via AWS SQS or BullMQ, selected dynamically at runtime.

### Configuration

The queue processing method and other configuration details are defined in the application configuration file. Key configurations include:

- **`config.queue.queueProcessingMethod`**: Determines the queue processing method (`aws-sqs` or `bullmq`).
- **`config.queue.name`**: Specifies the name of the queue to be processed.

### Example Configuration File

```javascript
export const config = {
  app: {
    port: 3000,
  },
  queue: {
    queueProcessingMethod: 'bullmq', // or 'aws-sqs'
    name: 'myQueue',
  },
};
```

**Queue Processing Methods**:
The server initializes the queue handler based on the `queueProcessingMethod` from the configuration file.

If the value is:
- `aws-sqs`: The `SQSTask` class is initialized.
- `bullmq`: The `BullMQTask` class is initialized.

1. AWS SQS
If queueProcessingMethod is set to aws-sqs, the application uses the SQSTask class to process the queue.

```javascript
queueProcessingTask = new SQSTask(config.queue.name);
```
SQSTask: A class that handles queue operations using AWS SQS.

2. BullMQ
If queueProcessingMethod is set to bullmq, the application uses the BullMQTask class for queue processing.

```javascript
queueProcessingTask = new BullMQTask(config.queue.name);
```
BullMQTask: A class that manages queue operations using BullMQ.

## Workflow
1. **Server**: Handles client requests to enqueue jobs into the queue.
2. **Worker**: Polls the queue and processes the jobs using the selected queue processing method.

## Server Workflow
The **server** accepts incoming job requests via the `/job` endpoint and enqueues these jobs into the appropriate queue (AWS SQS or BullMQ) based on the value of `queueProcessingMethod`.

## Adding a Job to the Queue

When a job is submitted to the `POST /job` endpoint, the server wraps them in a CloudEvent, and adds them to the appropriate queue based on the configured queue processing method (AWS SQS or BullMQ). This route dynamically processes jobs using either method by utilizing the `addJob` function, which submits the job to the queue. The job is then added to the queue using the `postMessage` method, which is implemented differently depending on the queue processing method (`aws-sqs` or `bullmq`).

#### Example Server Flow
1. **Incoming Request**: A job is submitted via `POST /job`.
2. **CloudEvent Creation**: The job data is wrapped in a CloudEvent for standardization.
3. **Job Enqueue**: The job is added to the appropriate queue (AWS SQS or BullMQ).
4. **Response**: The server returns a success or failure response based on whether the job was enqueued successfully.

### Endpoint

- **Method**: `POST`
- **URL**: `/job`
- **Description**: Accepts job data, enqueues it as a CloudEvent, and submits it to the appropriate queue based on the `queueProcessingMethod`.

### Request Headers

- **`Content-Type`**: The content type of the job data (e.g., `application/json`).
- **`Event-Type`**: Describes the type of event being submitted (can be used to categorize or filter job types).

### Request Body

The request body should contain the job data that needs to be processed.  
Example:

```json
{
  "jobData": {
    "taskId": "1234",
    "payload": {
      "message": "Process this task."
    }
  }
}
```
***Note***: The job could be anything like JSON, string, XML, or anything else will be accepted in request body.

**Response**
- **201 OK:** The job was successfully enqueued.
- **500 Internal Server Error:** There was an error adding the job to the queue.

## Worker Workflow
The worker is responsible for polling the queue and processing the jobs. The worker can handle the jobs in either AWS SQS or BullMQ, based on the `queueProcessingMethod`.

**Purpose:** Starts a worker that listens for and processes jobs from the queue.

**Queue Initialization:** The worker initializes either the `SQSTask` or `BullMQTask` class based on the `queueProcessingMethod`.

#### Continuous Job Listening and Processing:

1. **Start Worker:** When the worker is started, it begins an infinite loop to continuously listen for new jobs from the specified queue.

2. **Queue Polling:** The worker continuously polls the queue for available jobs at regular intervals.

3. **Job Availability Check:** If a job is available in the queue:
- The worker retrieves the job.
- Processes the job using the corresponding task class method (either `SQSTask` for AWS SQS or `BullMQTask` for BullMQ).

4. **Job Processing:** The worker executes the job processing logic. Depending on the outcome, the job is either marked as completed or logged as failed.

5. **Repeat:** After processing a job, the worker continues to listen for more jobs, repeating the process.

## AWS SQS Setup


To set up AWS SQS in your application, you will need to copy the following credentials from your AWS account:

- **AWS_ACCOUNT_ID**: Your AWS account ID.
- **AWS_QUEUE_NAME**: The name of your SQS queue.
- **AWS_REGION**: The region where your SQS queue is hosted.
- **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**: Your AWS access key ID.
- **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**: Your AWS secret access key.
- **AWS_SESSION_TOKEN**: Your AWS session token (only needed for temporary credentials).

### Steps to Copy Credentials Using AWS Management Console

#### 1. **Go to AWS Management Console**
- Navigate to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/).
- Log in using your AWS credentials.

#### 2. **Generate Keys and Session Tokens**
- After logging in, access the AWS Access Keys option.
- Click on Get Keys to generate a new pair of credentials (Access Key and Secret Key).

#### 3. **Copy Environment Setup Variables**
- After generating the keys, youâ€™ll be presented with an option to **copy** the environment setup variables directly.
- This will look something like:
  - For Linux or Mac:
    ```bash
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
    export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-session-token" # (if applicable)
    export AWS_REGION="your-region"

    And also you need to add these two:
    export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
    export AWS_QUEUE_NAME="your-queue-name"
    ```
  - For Windows:
    ```cmd
    set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
    set AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
    set AWS_SESSION_TOKEN=your-session-token # (if applicable)
    set AWS_REGION=your-region

    And also you need to add these two:
    set AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id
    set AWS_QUEUE_NAME=your-queue-name
    ```
- Once you have these credentials, you can configure them in your application to interact with AWS SQS.
**Key Points:**
- This method allows you to directly copy ***environment setup variables*** for AWS services, helping with abstraction.
- By exporting these variables, you can use them securely without embedding credentials in your source code.

## Swagger OpenAPI Documentation Access

## Swagger Documentation

This project uses Swagger for API documentation. The setup involves generating OpenAPI schemas and integrating them into a Swagger specification. Below is an overview of the process:

### Folder Structure

- **`src/swagger/`**: The main folder for Swagger-related files.
  - **`schemas/`**: Contains schema files for filters and feeds.
  - **`routes.yaml`**: Defines the OpenAPI specification for the APIs.
  - **`openapi-spec-generator.ts`**: Script that reads `routes.yaml` and schema files to generate the `swagger.yaml` file.

### Generating Schemas

The schema files in the `schemas/` folder are generated using the `typeconv` module. To generate these files, run the following command:

```
yarn typeconv -f ts -t oapi -o src/swagger/schemas src/types/*.ts
```

### Generating OpenAPI Specification

The `openapi-spec-generator.ts` script combines the routes defined in `routes.yaml` with the schemas to produce the `swagger.yaml` file. This file contains the complete OpenAPI specification.

### Post-Install Setup

The schema generation and OpenAPI specification creation are automated to run after installing dependencies. This ensures the documentation is always up-to-date. The following command is executed automatically:

```
yarn typeconv -f ts -t oapi -o src/swagger/schemas src/types/*.ts && yarn ts-node src/swagger/openapi-spec-generator.ts
```

### Manual Update

If you update the types and need to regenerate the documentation, you can manually run the following script defined in `package.json`:

```
yarn generate-openapi-spec
```

This script performs the same actions as the post-install process, regenerating the schemas and OpenAPI specification.

## Overview of Repository Functions

This documentation provides an overview of repository and database operations, with a focus on using Prisma ORM.

### Introduction

This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide to repository and database operations, specifically using Prisma ORM with a PostgreSQL relational database.

**Prisma ORM Integration:** Utilizes Prisma ORM for database operations, including migrations and client generation.

**Schema Management:** Handles schema migrations with Prisma, specified in the `./src/prisma/schema.prisma` file.

**Seeding:** Seeds the database with initial data using `src/repos/seed.ts`.

### Prisma ORM Overview

Prisma provides a type-safe database client and a powerful data modeling tool. Key features include:

- **Automatic Type Safety**: Reduces runtime errors by providing type safety.
- **Intuitive Data Modeling**: Easy-to-use schema definition and migrations.
- **Efficient Queries**: Optimized query performance and database access.
  - [Prisma Documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/)
  - [Prisma GitHub Repository](https://github.com/prisma/prisma)
  - [Prisma Examples](https://github.com/prisma/prisma-examples)
  - [Prisma Blog](https://www.prisma.io/blog/)

This documentation should help you get started with repository and database operations using Prisma ORM. For more detailed information, refer to the official Prisma documentation and resources.

### Post-Install Setup
While installing dependencies, models are automatically created in the database, seeding is also done, and the Prisma client is generated.
We can manually set up these things:
- To set up the tables: `yarn prisma migrate dev --schema ./src/prisma/schema.prisma`
- To set up the seeding: `yarn ts-node src/repos/seed.ts`
- To generate the Prisma client: `yarn prisma generate --schema ./src/prisma/schema.prisma`

**adBreaks**: *Identified by a unique **mediaId**, with **markers** stored as JSON.*
### Database Operations
- #### Repository Functions

  This boilerplate provides a structured approach to managing database operations through repository functions. Below is an overview of key repository functions:

  - #### Feed

    The `Feed` repository is responsible for managing operations related to the `Feed` model. Key functions include:

    - **`getFeeds()`**: Fetches all feed records from the database.
      - return type:
        ```json
        {
          "data": [
            {
              "id": "string",
              "path": "string",
              "name": "string"
            }
          ]
        }
        ```
    - **`getFeedById(feedId: string)`**: Retrieves a specific feed by its ID.
      - return type:
        ```json
        {
          "data": {
            "id": "string",
            "path": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "config": "JsonValue",
            "queryParams": "JsonValue[]"
          }
        }
        ```
    - **`createFeed(req: { path: string, name: string, config: object, queryParams: FeedQueryParams[] })`**: Creates a new feed record with the specified parameters.
      - return type:
        ```json
        {
          "data": {
            "id": "string",
            "path": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "config": "JsonValue",
            "queryParams": "JsonValue[]"
          }
        }
        ```
    - **`updateFeed(feedId: string, updates: { path?: string, name?: string, config: {}, queryParams: FeedQueryParams[] })`**: Updates an existing feed record by ID.
      - return type:
        ```json
        {
          "data": {
            "id": "string",
            "path": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "config": "JsonValue",
            "queryParams": "JsonValue[]"
          }
        }
        ```
    - **`deleteFeed(feedId: string)`**: Deletes a feed record by ID.
    - return type: If the feed is successfully deleted, then the response is
      ```json
       {
         "data": null
       }
       ```

      These functions interact with the Prisma ORM to perform the CRUD operations on the `Feed` model, ensuring that all interactions with the database are handled efficiently and consistently.

  - #### Filter

    The `Filter` repository handles operations related to the `Filter` model. Key functions include:

    - **`getFilters()`**: Retrieves all filter records from the database.
    - return type:
      ```json
      {
        "data": [
          {
            "id": "string",
            "name": "string",
            "type": "string",
          }
        ]
      }
      ```
    - **`getFilterById(filterId: string)`**: Retrieves a specific filter by its ID.
    - return type:
      ```json
      {
        "data": {
          "id": "string",
          "name": "string",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "string",
          "code": "string",
          "filterParams": "JsonValue[]"
        }
      }
      ```
    - **`createFilter(req: { name: string, type: string, description?: string, code?: string | null, filterParams: FilterParams[] })`**: Creates a new filter with the provided details.
    - return type:
      ```json
      {
        "data": {
          "id": "string",
          "name": "string",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "string",
          "code": "string",
          "filterParams": "JsonValue[]"
        }
      }
      ```
    - **`updateFilter(filterId: string, updates: { name?: string, type?: string, description?: string, code?: string | null, filterParams: FilterParams[] })`**: Updates an existing filter by ID.
    - return type:
      ```json
      {
        "data": {
          "id": "string",
          "name": "string",
          "type": "string",
          "description": "string",
          "code": "string",
          "filterParams": "JsonValue[]"
        }
      }
      ```
    - **`deleteFilter(filterId: string)`**: Deletes a filter by ID.
    - return type: If the filter is successfully deleted, then the response is
      ```json
       {
         "data": null
       }
       ```

    - **Note**: All return types are success types. If the operation fails, the return type is an error type.
      These repository functions ensure that the `Filter` model is managed effectively, enabling precise filtering capabilities within your application.

- #### Usage

  To understand the usage of `feed` and `filter` functions in the repository, refer to the test cases provided in `src/repos/repo.test.ts`.

  To execute the tests for the repository functions, run the following command in your terminal:

  ```
  yarn test-repo
  ```

  The `repo` function returns an object with the following structure:

  - **Success**: When the operation is successful, the function returns an object containing the data.

    ```json
    {
      "data": <T>
    }
    ```

    Here, `T` represents the type of the operation being returned (template type).

  - **Failure**: When the operation fails, the function returns an object containing an error message.
    ```json
    {
      "error": "string"
    }
    ```
    The `error` field contains a string describing the error that occurred.

## JWT Middleware

### Overview

This section outlines the JWT (JSON Web Token) middleware used for authenticating requests to our API's.

### Middleware Functionality

This middleware is responsible for validating incoming JWTs to ensure that:

- The token is correctly signed.
- The token is issued by a trusted source.
- The token includes the expected audience and issuer.

### Key Components

1. **Key Management**: Utilizes a JWKS (JSON Web Key Set) for retrieving public keys used to verify JWT signatures.
2. **Audience and Issuer Validation**: Checks that the token's audience and issuer match expected values to ensure proper access control.

### Configuration

The middleware relies on specific configuration settings which are specified in config file:

- **webKeySetUrl**: URL for retrieving public keys necessary for signature verification.
- **audience**: Expected audience claim for the JWT.
- **issuer**: Expected issuer claim for the JWT.

### Usage

#### Sample Token:
```
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCIsImtpZCI6InRXYVJfU2h5cElJUEF1TnlkUEhmYiJ9.eyJodHRwOi8vZ3JvdXAiOiJncnBfdmlld2VyIiwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9kZXYtZnVscnhtYjh0Zmg1a2U4by51cy5hdXRoMC5jb20vIiwic3ViIjoiZ29vZ2xlLW9hdXRoMnwxMDQ4MDU1MDQ1MTM5MDcyNDE3MTEiLCJhdWQiOiJodHRwczovL2Rldi1mdWxyeG1iOHRmaDVrZThvLnVzLmF1dGgwLmNvbS9hcGkvdjIvIiwiaWF0IjoxNzI3MzU3Mjg2LCJleHAiOjE3Mjc0NDM2ODYsImF6cCI6IlBuRWl0SXF5RTM0SkROZVVaaUliWTQyeldJa1ZyaWxMIn0.eMQrXL4GH4j8fh_v5vBhAzfn4DjXP3ByU4dEGG_2kRLkJc4R-mzseg1MflZNJaND0XrG8jeMhqmpCzRxWWZDw0u80Z0cVNXAaVNOLLfBqk-2gjBULWy3n0AwwjklIG7FAqbZzPTA6UD6DhC1ZXmshSJU71uNPFUJlOdAUTVuFDkNDpqCh4o9sMacDu5WWoFkvpN814TXaKjsnjEbg0PeQlob9qz8HvCLQm8Xm1h8fT0XbCZBPNtaF1n97L43f0iizbdYIEaeRddQ22b7au47MNNNEnuRxZSW21jeNnF3dJ6CsKsr4vjkFXmXqCuU9BZlBZW8h6zBvWJ2RtCMW2oeEg
```

To use this token, include it in the `headers` section of your request as follows:

```javascript
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

Replace <your-token> with the actual JWT token provided above. Ensure to use this token for authenticated requests to routes which can be accessed by viewer's group.

To know more about groups and their permissions of our application, please refer to the [Roles and Permissions](#roles-and-permissions-middleware)

# Docker Setup

# Roles and Permissions Middleware

This document explains how the `checkRolesAndPermissions` middleware works for handling **authorization** in your Express.js application. It defines role-based access control for different HTTP methods and routes, allowing users with specific roles or groups to perform actions on specific resources.

## Concepts

1. **Group**: A set of users who share the same permissions (e.g., `grp_viewer`, `grp_editor`, `grp_admin`). These groups map to certain roles, which determine the actions they can perform.

2. **Role**: Defines the permissions or capabilities of a user. Each group is associated with a role (e.g., "viewer," "editor," "admin"). For example:
   - **Viewers** can read resources.
   - **Editors** can read and modify resources.
   - **Admins** have access to all resources.

3. **Permissions**: The allowed HTTP methods and routes that a group can access. Permissions are mapped to specific HTTP methods and paths, or to a wildcard `*_*` that grants all permissions for admin users.

## Role-Permission Mapping (`groupRoleMapping`)

The role-permission mapping defines what actions (HTTP methods and paths) each group is allowed to perform. This is stored in the `groupRoleMapping` object.

## Middleware Workflow

The checkRolesAndPermissions middleware checks if a user (based on their group) has the appropriate permissions to access a particular route.

### Steps:

1. **Extract Group**: The userâ€™s group is identified. In this example, it's hardcoded as "grp_editor", but typically it would be retrieved from the req object (e.g., from req.auth.group).

2. **Check Group Permissions**: The middleware looks up the group's permissions in the groupRoleMapping. If the group doesn't exist, the request is denied.

3. **Admin Check**: If the group has the \*_\* wildcard (like grp_admin), all routes are automatically accessible, and the middleware allows the request to continue (next()).

4. **Path & Method Check**: The middleware constructs a key by combining the HTTP method and request path (e.g., GET_/feed). It checks if this key exists in the group's permissions:
    - If the key exists and the permission is true, the user is allowed to proceed.
    - If not, the user is denied access with a 403 Forbidden response.

This middleware will run before protected routes and ensure that only users with the correct group permissions can access them.

### Key Points

- **Role-based access control**: Permissions are based on roles assigned to groups.
- **Granular control**: Permissions are granted per HTTP method and path, allowing fine-grained access.
- **Admin override**: Admin users have complete access via the wildcard *_*.

### Scenarios

**Viewer Request**:
- A user in the grp_viewer group tries to access GET /feed:id. Since this is allowed in the mapping, the request proceeds.
- If the same user tries to POST /feed, they will be denied.

**Editor Request**:
- A user in the grp_editor group has more permissions. They can POST and PUT to /feed and /filter resources.
- If they attempt to access something outside their permissions (e.g., DELETE /feed), they will be denied.

**Admin Request**:
- A user in the grp_admin group can access any route or resource, regardless of the method or path.

### Error Handling

If a user tries to access a resource they don't have permissions for:
- They receive a 403 Forbidden response with a message: "Forbidden - You do not have the necessary permissions.
